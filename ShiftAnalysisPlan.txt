Shift Analysis Development Checklist
-----------------------------------
- [x] Generalize existing tooling into a reusable shift analysis application.
- [x] Provide CLI subcommands for `readdir`, `convert`, `calc-shift`, `plot`, and an `auto` command that runs all stages sequentially.
- [x] ReadDirectory stage
    - [x] Scan the working directory or optional path for files matching `XXX_LOT_EVENT_INTERVAL.xlsx` or `.stdf`.
    - [x] Extract LOT/EVENT/INTERVAL metadata and display for confirmation.
    - [x] Abort when the user declines confirmation; proceed and persist metadata otherwise.
- [x] ConvertToData stage
    - [x] Reuse and refactor existing merge logic to build a `DataWorkBook` without copying raw worksheets.
    - [x] Maintain summary pass/fail counts for Excel sources using `analyze_unit_results`.
    - [x] Parse STDF files via `istdf`, keeping only the last record per serial number and using the pass/fail flag.
    - [x] Populate Summary and Measurements sheets with required columns and no hyperlink references.
- [x] CalculateShift stage
    - [x] Create a sheet with the specified columns summarizing min/max interval statistics.
    - [x] Order intervals as Prescreen (case-insensitive), then ascending numeric, then remaining strings alphabetically.
    - [x] Compute mean, median (unused scaffolding), and standard deviation change from min to max interval.
- [x] GeneratePlot stage
    - [x] Default to generating both boxplot and histogram sheets into the DataWorkBook.
    - [x] Support `--BoxChartOnly` and `--HistoChartOnly` options to limit output.
    - [x] Produce per-event sheets following existing formatting conventions.
- [x] GUI scaffolding
    - [x] Provide a lightweight module/class marked `TBD` for future GUI integration.
- [x] Validation
    - [x] Use the smallest sample file to execute the pipeline and ensure no fatal errors.
