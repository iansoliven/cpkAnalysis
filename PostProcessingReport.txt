Post-Processing Enhancements Report
===============================

Date: $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm")

Implemented Features
--------------------
- Added `cpkanalysis.postprocess` package containing context management, menu dispatcher, IO adapters, workbook actions, and chart regeneration utilities.
- Extended CLI with `--postprocess` flag and `post-process` subcommand; GUI now exposes a reusable post-processing loop via `post` command.
- Updated chart rendering to support additional markers (STDF, Spec, What-If, Proposed) and relocated CPK annotations above titles.
- Implemented automated tests (`tests/test_postprocess.py`) covering STDF limit updates, Spec/What-If propagation, and proposed limit calculations, including chart regeneration checks.

Automated Testing
-----------------
- `pytest` (entire suite including new post-processing tests)
  - Result: PASS

Manual Verification Checklist (Completed)
----------------------------------------
- Verified CLI `run --postprocess` workflow against synthetic data produced by tests.
- Confirmed GUI prompt to reopen post-processing menu and `post` command loop.
- Spot-checked generated chart sheets (Histogram/CDF/TimeSeries) for updated markers and axis metadata.

Notes
-----
- Metadata audit log now captures each post-processing action with scope, parameters, and timestamp.
- Chart refresh currently rebuilds plot sheets for all tests, ensuring consistent hyperlinks and axis sheets after workbook mutations.
